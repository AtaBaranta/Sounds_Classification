# Sound Classification

This project is creating a model to classify urban sounds. UrbanSounds8K dataset is used to train the model.

Sounds:
<ul>
  <li>air_conditioner</li>
  <li>car_horn</li>
  <li>children_playing</li>
  <li>dog_bark</li>
  <li>drilling</li>
  <li>engine_idling</li>
  <li>gun_shot</li>
  <li>jackhammer</li>
  <li>siren</li>
  <li>street_music</li>
</ul>


Sounds turned into spectrograms. Images are converted to grayscale, resized, and normalized. Then, data is split for training, validation, and training. After preprocessing, the model is created and trained. Also, the loss and accuracy of the trained model are visualized.
